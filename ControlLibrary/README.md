# Variational Dynamic Programming for Stochastic Optimal Control

## Object
The control library is think to siumate a stochastic dynamic and 
to design a stochastic controler. The abstract classes are in \[[Core][0]\]
and are specified as a Penudlum dynamic in \[[StochasticDynamicsExample][1]\] and 
a LQR controler  in \[[LQR][2]\] and a variational controler in \[[KLcontrol][3]\].
