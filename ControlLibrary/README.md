# Variational Dynamic Programming for Stochastic Optimal Control

## Object
The control library is thought to simulate a general stochastic dynamic and 
to design a stochastic controller. The abstract classes are in \[[Core][0]\]. 
The abstract stochastic dynamic is specified in \[[StochasticDynamicsExample][1]\] including the Pendulum and the constant velocity model in 2D. The abstract controller is specified 
as a LQR controller  in \[[LQR][2]\] and as a variational controller in \[[KLcontrol][3]\].
