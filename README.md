# Variational Dynamic Programming for Stochastic Optimal Control

## Object

This is the companion code for the paper \[[1] (To appear) \]. Please cite this paper if you use this code.  

## Installation
The code is available in python using the standard library. 

## Model
The dynamic is encoded in a Langevin SDE of the form:
$$dv_t=f(x_t,v_t,u_t)dt+Ldw_t; \quad dx_t=v_tdt; w_t \mathcal{N}(0,C)$$

## python files
The source of the KL controller for the inverted pendulum problem.
